/*
* Create a simple calculator class that implements basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using pure functions.
* Each function should take two arguments and return the result of the operation without modifying any external state. Use “final” keyword to prevent reassignment
* of variables. Test the class by creating instances of it and calling the methods with different inputs, making sure that the results are correct and the state of
* the class doesn't change.
